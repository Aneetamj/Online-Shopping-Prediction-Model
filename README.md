# Online-Shopping-Prediction-Model

This dataset contains detailed information about online shopper sessions, with the goal of predicting the likelihood of a purchase based on various session behaviors. Collected from a yearâ€™s worth of real-time data from an e-commerce website, the dataset includes 12,330 sessions across 17 features.The dataset was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period.


The target variable in this dataset is Revenue, which indicates whether a visitor made a purchase during the session (True/False). This makes the dataset ideal for classification tasks, where the objective is to predict the likelihood of a purchase based on user behavior and session attributes.


By analyzing this dataset, we can identify key factors that influence purchasing decisions and provide insights into optimizing marketing strategies, website design, and customer experience to boost conversion rates.
